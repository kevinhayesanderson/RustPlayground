Rust:
  - An Associated function is a function that's implemented on a type.
  - Enumeration, often called an enum, which is a type that can be in one of multiple states:
      - Each possible state is called a variant.
  - Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File:
      - it’s often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.
  - Shadowing lets us reuse the variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables:
  - On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, \r\n:
      - The trim method eliminates \n or \r\n
Datatypes:
  two data type subsets:
    - scalar
    - compound
  Rust is a statically typed language:
    - which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time
Scalar Types:
  A scalar type represents a single value:
  Rust has four primary scalar types:
    - integers:
        - Rust’s defaults are generally good places to start: integer types default to i32.
        - The primary situation in which you'd use isize or usize is when indexing some sort of collection.

    - floating-point numbers:
        - Rust’s floating-point types are f32 and f64
        - The binary format of a 32-bit single-precision float variable is s-eeeeeeee-fffffffffffffffffffffff, where s=sign, e=exponent, and f=fractional part (mantissa).
          - A single-precision float only has about 7 decimal digits of precision (actually the log base 10 of 223, or about 6.92 digits of precision).
          - The greater the integer part is, the less space is left for floating part precision.

    - Booleans
    - characters:
        - Rust’s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII.
          - Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.
          - Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive.
Compound types:
  - Compound types can group multiple values into one type.
  - Rust has two primitive compound types:
      - tuples:
          - The tuple without any values has a special name, unit.
          - This value and its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type.
          - Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t return any other value.
      - arrays:
