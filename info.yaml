Rust:
  - An Associated function is a function that's implemented on a type.
  - Enumeration, often called an enum, which is a type that can be in one of multiple states:
      - Each possible state is called a variant.
  - Ensuring Reproducible Builds with the Cargo.lock File:
      - itâ€™s often checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.
  - Shadowing lets us reuse the variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables:
  - On Windows, pressing enter results in a carriage return and a newline, \r\n:
      - The trim method eliminates \n or \r\n
